Years ago I set about to reuse the [SQLite](http://sqlite.org/) source with Berkeley DB functioning as the storage manager.  As I set about to do this I also completely changed the SQLite code, mostly in format but with some other changes.  The project finished up when DBSQL was functional, but not fully debugged.  I used this prototype to help justify the work to do much the same within the Berkeley DB group in Oracle.  Berkeley DB now has a good integration with SQLite, so this project is defunct.","name":"DBSQL","google":""}

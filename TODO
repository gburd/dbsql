* Check all DB API calls
   Make sure a) we check return codes for for all calls into DB and
    that b) when there is an error we output it only when configured
    to be verbose and c) then return the proper DBSQL error indicating
    what went wrong at a higher level.

* Review all reused DB code
   Make sure that we're up to date with the latest in DB.  Things such
    as hashing, etc.

* splint

* makedepend

* valgrind

* Review SQLite's latest lemon.c and lempar.c code

* Review code for trailing spaces, tab characters, lines > 79 col

* api.c/__os_sleep()
  This is now static in DB's code, so to hack the compile I commented
   out the use of __os_sleep() in api.c
